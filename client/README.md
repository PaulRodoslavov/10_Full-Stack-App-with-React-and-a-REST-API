# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree v2 - REST API Project

## Overview of the Provided Project

In this project, I've created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

Then I used React to create a client for my existing school database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

## Getting Started

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm` for /client and /api

```
npm install

```

Second, ensure that you have MongoDB installed globally on your system and run the command

```
mongod

```

Third, seed your MongoDB database with data in folder /api

```
npm run seed

```

And lastly, start the server in /api and client in /client

```
npm start

```
